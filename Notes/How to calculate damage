Two types of damage 
  - magic 
  - physical
  
Each move does ONE type of damage 
  
DAMAGE ALGORITHM
  
Generates random amount of damage based on character's (atk + atk_bonus) and moves ( atk_dmg )
  - range is wider as base damage is higher
  - atk_pwr = character.atk + character.atk_bonus + move.atk_dmg
  - range = (atk_pwr - (atk_pwr/5))..(atk_pwr + (atk_pwr/5))
  - 0-4 = range of 0, 5-9 = range of 1, 10-14 = range of 2, etc.
  
Subtracts rand # picked from a range based on defender's defense 
  - uses same mechanics as attack damage 
  - dfs_pwr = character.dfs + character.dfs_bonus
  
Magic damage calculated similar to physical, but it depends on both character's magic stats
